# Kotlin
It reminds me when we were doing procedural programming with turbo c and in the next course, we started with cpp that introduce us with object-oriented programming.

After reviewing Kotlin, I am not sure either we are progressing with programming or returning back to turbo C (It's up to you to decide)

The current project cover most of the topics in kotlin.
